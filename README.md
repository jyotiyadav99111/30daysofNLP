# 30daysofNLP
The repository contains the very basics of NLP to the advances knowledge and projects. I started a series on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoti-yadav-b8232969/) for 30 days and using this reository to storing the corresponding code. It started on 1st June 2021 and will end on 20th June 2021. The days that are not present here in git are article or theory days.
